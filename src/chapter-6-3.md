In this chapter, we will explore strategies for sustaining a regular mindful compassion practice. While overcoming obstacles to practicing mindful compassion is important, it is equally important to develop a sustainable and consistent practice over time.

Creating a Routine
------------------

Creating a routine can help us sustain a regular mindful compassion practice. Some strategies for creating a routine include:

1. Setting aside specific times each day for mindfulness practice, such as in the morning or before bed.
2. Incorporating mindfulness into daily routines, such as while brushing teeth or during a lunch break.
3. Using reminders, such as alarms or sticky notes, to help remember to practice mindfulness.

Finding Accountability

Finding accountability can also help us sustain a regular mindful compassion practice. Some strategies for finding accountability include:

1. Practicing mindfulness with a friend or partner.
2. Joining a mindfulness group or class.
3. Seeking support from a therapist or mindfulness teacher.

Adapting to Change
------------------

Adapting to change is an important part of sustaining a regular mindful compassion practice. Some strategies for adapting to change include:

1. Being flexible with our mindfulness practice when life gets busy or stressful.
2. Focusing on progress, not perfection, in our practice.
3. Accepting that our practice may look different from day to day or week to week.

Celebrating Progress
--------------------

Celebrating progress can help us sustain a regular mindful compassion practice by reinforcing the benefits of our practice. Some strategies for celebrating progress include:

1. Acknowledging small successes in our practice, such as noticing a shift in our mood or behavior.
2. Creating a journal or log to track progress and reflect on our practice.
3. Sharing our progress with others, such as friends or colleagues.
